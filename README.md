# Homelessness Prediction Model
The 2020 [point-in-time count](https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2020/July/01-homeless-count.aspx) of people experiencing homelessness for Seattle/King County was 11,751. This represents a 5% increase over the 2019 count and reflects similar trend across many counties in the western U.S. A step towards addressing homelessness is improving our understanding of the relationship between local housing market factors and homelessness. 

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) produced a report in 2019 [Market Predictors of Homelessness](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf) that describes a model-based approach to understanding of the relationship between local housing market factors, policies, demographics, climate and homelessness. Our project is motivated by the goals of the HUD study:

"To continue progressing toward the goals of ending and preventing homelessness, we must further our knowledge of the basic community-level determinants of homelessness. The primary objectives of this study are to (1) identify market factors that have established effects on homelessness, (2) construct and evaluate empirical models of community-level homelessness.."

We will investigate whether there are alternative modeling approaches that outperform the models described in the HUD report.
